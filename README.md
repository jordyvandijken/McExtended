# McExtended
A plugin to enhance the Minecraft experience while staying faithful to the original game.


## This plugin adds some features that make the game more convenient and fun, without changing the core mechanics or balance. Here are some of the features:

- Auto replant crops with a hoe. Just left-click on a fully grown crop and it will drop its loot (-1 seed to replant itself) and replant itself.
- Turn stripped log back into normal log with an axe. If you accidentally stripped a log, you can undo it by right-clicking on it with an axe.
- Auto open doors. No need to click on doors anymore, they will open and close automatically as you approach or leave them.
- More items to decompose. You can decompose more items mainly food item and things like rotten meat or spider eye.
- Giving the dispenser the ability to use tools to mine the block in front of them when powered. This allows you to create automated mining machines or traps.
- Inventory sorting. Double-click to sort the inventory that is clicked
- Auto open double doors on interaction (shift to open single) 


## Some ideas for future updates:

- Some enchantments that add new effects or abilities to your tools and weapons.
- Some auto crafting that lets you craft items without opening a crafting table, such as sticks, planks, torches, etc.
- Autoplay music discs into a jukebox, using hoppers to insert them and take them out when done.
- Extend loottable that gives some animals a chance to drop bones, such as cows, pigs, sheep, etc.
- Flying speed Displayed like the text when playing music disc
